And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n","\n","Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n","\n","While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\n","\n","### ***- Goal***\n","Minimize the number of clients who are rejected but actually have the capability of repayment.\n","\n","### ***- Objective***\n","Create predictive model to determine potential client and default client.\n","\n","### ***- Business Metric***\n","Decreased Loss Given Default (LGD).\n","\n","The amount of money a financial institution loses when a borrower defaults on a loan, after taking into consideration any recovery, represented as a percentage of total exposure at the time of loss.\n","Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lossgivendefault.asp#:~:text=Loss%20Given%20Default%20(LGD)%20FAQs,-What%20Does%20Loss&text=Given%20Default%20Mean%3F-,Loss%20given%20default%20(LGD)%20is%20the%20amount%20of%20money%20a,at%20the%20time%20of%20loss.\n","\n","Assumption: losses due to default are only calculated from the client's total credit.\n","\n","### ***- Model Evaluation***\n","Area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target."],"id":"e989f950-8080-4412-89e1-ef815e05a58a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d97f34c1-e990-4caa-940d-f6f8ce9d279e"},"source":["### **Datafile Selection**\n","\n","Three datafiles are selected for modeling:\n","1. **application_train**: data for current credit application and binary TARGET variable.
